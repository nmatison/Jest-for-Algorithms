# Algorithm Jest Specs
This is currently a work in progress. The idea behind this is to build specs that will allow students to work on their data structures and algorithms in javascript with a skeleton and specs to help them along. If you see something that needs to be fixed, feel free to create an issue or pull request. You can also just message me. 

If you would like to contribute ***please feel free to do so!!!*** Just open up a pull request or an issue.
